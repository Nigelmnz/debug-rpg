# Debug-RPG

In this incremental game, you are the lead developer for a tiny and new startup, HipsterTech.
You hate it. Officially, while your job is to write code, you only get paid when you debug something. You are paid 2$ per bug solved.
Further, the codebase is absolutely terrible. It's constantly generating bugs, the larger it becomes, the more bugs it generates. The CEO is also constantly watching. If you ever have more than 500 unsolved bugs, you will fired immediately.

Eventually, you decide you've had enough, so you tell Carol in HR that you are quitting in 30 days. You want to make as much cash as possible before leaving, but you aren't motivated to do much for HipsterTech. Maybe you can outsource?
